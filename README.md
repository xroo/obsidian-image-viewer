# Obsidian Image Viewer

> I uploaded a lot of image references to my project vault and wanted to watch them directly inside Obsidian. The Obsidian's default image viewer is extremely simple. I searched for better viewer and haven't found any suitable for me. So I vibe coded one.

**Image Viewer** is a minimalist plugin for viewing images in folder and navigate through it with a thumbnail strip and by arrows and wheel.
